## DEPRECATION NOTICE: Do not add new tests to this file!
##
## View and controller tests are deprecated in the Growstuff project.
## We no longer write new view and controller tests, but instead write
## feature tests (in spec/features) using Capybara (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).
## These test the full stack, behaving as a browser, and require less complicated setup
## to run. Please feel free to delete old view/controller tests as they are reimplemented
## in feature tests.
##
## If you submit a pull request containing new view or controller tests, it will not be
## merged.
