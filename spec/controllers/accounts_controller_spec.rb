## DEPRECATION NOTICE: Do not add new tests to this file!
##
## View and controller tests are deprecated in the Growstuff project.
## We no longer write new view and controller tests, but instead write
## feature tests (in spec/features) using Capybara (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).
## These test the full stack, behaving as a browser, and require less complicated setup
## to run. Please feel free to delete old view/controller tests as they are reimplemented
## in feature tests.
##
## If you submit a pull request containing new view or controller tests, it will not be
## merged.

describe AccountsController do
  login_member(:admin_member)

  def valid_attributes
    { "paid_until" => Time.now }
  end

  def create_account
    # account details are automatically created when you create a new
    # member; creating them manually will just cause errors as only one is
    # allowed. This method has been left here in case it's useful in
    # future.
    member = FactoryBot.create(:member)
    member.account
