# This file is an empty sample file which you (i.e. Growstuff
# developers) can copy and use to store your API credentials for
# external APIs used by the Growstuff application.

# To use this file, simply copy it to credentials.sh (which is
# .gitignore'd) and then fill in whatever credentials you need.  Then in
# the window where you run "rails s", first run:
#
#     source credentials.sh
#
# If you then run "rails s", it will have all the environment variables
# available to it.
