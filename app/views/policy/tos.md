# Growstuff Terms of Service

We hate legalese, so we've tried to make our Terms of Service readable. If you've got any questions, feel free to [ask us](mailto:support@growstuff.org), and we'll do our best to answer.

Growstuff Pty Ltd ("we", "us", "our", "Growstuff") present the following terms and conditions, which govern your use of the Growstuff website at [growstuff.org](http://growstuff.org), and all content, services and products available at or through the website, which we collectively refer to as "the Service".

To use the Service, you need to agree to these Terms of Service, along with all other policies we publish (including, but not limited to, Growstuff's Privacy Policy, API and Data Use Policy, Copyright Infringement Policy and Community Guidelines). We refer to this as "the Agreement".

Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree that you are bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Your Account

If you create an account on the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under the account. You must take reasonable steps to guard the security of your account. We will not be liable for anything that happens if your account security is breached as a result of your failure to protect it.

## 2. Account Structure

Growstuff currently has three types of accounts:

* Free Accounts are available free of charge. Free accounts can access basic site functions, but do not receive access to premium features.
* Paid Accounts are available for term-based fee and receive access to a number of premium features.  When your Paid Account expires, it will revert to a Free Account until you pay for it again.
* Permanent Accounts are reserved for those who have contributed significantly to the Growstuff project, at our discretion. They receive all features available to paid accounts, for as long as Growstuff continues to operate, without need for future payment.

Payments to Growstuff, for account services or for any other purpose, are refundable or transferable solely at Growstuff's discretion.

By using this Service, you agree to this account structure, and to Growstuff's right to change, modify, or discontinue any type of account or the features available to it at any time.

## 3. Content policy

Our content policy relates to any material you may post on the Growstuff website or through the Service, which we call "Content".  This includes profile information, posts and comments, information about your food growing activity, and any other material, whether text, graphics, or any other format, which you may post on Growstuff itself or link to from Growstuff.

All Content posted to the Service in any way is the responsibility of the owner. If Content is deemed illegal by any law having jurisdiction over you, you agree that we may submit any necessary information to the proper authorities.

We claim no ownership or control over any Content that you post to the Service.  You retain any intellectual property rights to the Content you post, in accordance with applicable law.  By posting Content, you represent that you have the rights to reproduce that Content (and the right to allow us to serve such Content) without violation of the rights of any third party. You agree that you will bear any liability resulting from the posting of any Content that you do not have the rights to post.

You grant us a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content, solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting the contents of your account, through any part of the Service including through our API, feeds, and external clients.

If you delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Service, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

### 3.1 Structured Data

There is a subset of Content which we refer to as "Structured Data".  Structured Data is Content which represents simple facts, rather than creative effort.  For instance, locations, dates, or the type and number of crops you have planted are Structured Data.  Structured Data may be created explicitly by you or implicitly by the Website in response to your activity.

By using the Service, you acknowledge that Structured Data will be gathered and stored by Growstuff, and that any Structured Data pertaining to you or your activity may be made available for use by third parties under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license. You also agree that attribution for the Structured Data under the terms of the Creative Commons license will be given to Growstuff.

### 3.2 Content Posted on Other Websites

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which we, any user, or any provider of Content links, or that link to us. We do not have any control over those websites and webpages, and are not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to an external website or webpage, we do not represent or imply that we endorse such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of external websites and webpages, whether that link is provided by us or by any provider of Content on the Service.

### 3.3 How we deal with problem Content

You agree that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content you find offensive or objectionable.

We do not pre-screen Content. However, you acknowledge that we have the right (but not the obligation), in our sole discretion, to remove or refuse to remove any Content from the Service. If such Content is reported to us, it will be our sole discretion as to what action, if any, should be taken.

If any Content you have submitted is reported to us as violating this Agreement, you agree that we may call upon you to change, modify, or remove that Content, within a reasonable amount of time, as defined by us. If you do not follow this directive, we may terminate your account.
