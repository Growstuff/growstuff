# This file is a sample file which you (i.e. Growstuff developers) can
# copy and use to store your API credentials for external APIs used by
# the Growstuff application.

# We are progressively moving config variables out of
# config/environments/*.rb and into this application.yml config instead.
# Please do not add new config variables to config/environments.
# There are however a couple of exceptions to this, particularly config
# variables used by the assets pipeline, which cannot access ENV.  These
# include:
#   mapbox_map_id

# To use it, copy application.yml.example to application.yml (which is
# .gitignored) and fill in the appropriate values.

# Settings in this file will be available to you as ENV['WHATEVER']

# NOTE=please prefix all environment variables with GROWSTUFF_ to make
# it easy to identify which were set by us vs. the system or anyone else
