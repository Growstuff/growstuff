Welcome to the Growstuff project.

Growstuff is an open source/open data project to create a website for food gardeners.

You can find most of our documentation at: http://wiki.growstuff.org/

Our development uses Extreme Programming practices, which means we pair on all our work.  Feel free to fork our code and explore, but if you would like to contribute back to us,
