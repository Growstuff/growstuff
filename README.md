Welcome to the Growstuff project.

You can find our app at https://www.growstuff.org

Growstuff is an open source/open data project for food gardeners.  We
crowdsource information on what our members are growing and harvesting,
aggregate it, and make it available as open data via our API.

Growstuff was founded in 2012 and has been built by dozens of
[contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).  We are an inclusive, welcoming project, and
encourage participation from people of all backgrounds and skill levels.
