Growstuff is a community by and for food-gardeners.  Together, we are building a website where we can share our experience, knowledge, and the products of our harvest.  The most important thing about Growstuff is the people.  Without each of us adding our crops, sharing our knowledge, or helping to build the site itself, Growstuff won't be able to thrive.

Whatever your interest in Growstuff you are welcome here, and will be treated with respect.  In particular:

- We welcome people of any age, gender identity or expression, ethnicity, nationality, religion or lack thereof, political opinion, sexual orientation, marital status, family structure, ability or disability, appearance, subculture, or other identity or self-identification.

- Although Growstuff is primarily focused on food gardening, we welcome all kinds of gardeners.  In particular we welcome organic and conventional growers; those who grow their crops in fields or on balconies or in hydroponic systems; those who garden commercially or non-commercially; those who subsist off their crops and those who do it as a hobby. 

- We welcome people of all skill and experience levels, and will never dismiss you or comment rudely because you are new or just learning.

- Every role in our community is important, including gardeners who contribute skills, knowledge, and information to our site; coders, designers and other techies who help build it; moderators and others who help our community thrive; or any other form of participation.  We believe in working together, and prioritise communication and mutual understanding.

    
By participating in the Growstuff community (which includes our website and any auxiliary forums such as our mailing list(s), IRC channel, etc), you need to agree to our general commitment to inclusiveness and mutual respect, as well as to the following specific rules:

- The Growstuff project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all participants.  Harassment includes slurs directed at individuals or groups; unwanted sexual remarks directed at any person or group; sexually explicit comments or imagery in public spaces; stalking or other repeated, unwanted contact; or any repeated or sustained behaviour intended to disrupt someone else's enjoyment of the Growstuff site or community.

- The privacy of our community members is very important.  You may not disclose any member's personal details (including their legal name, location, employment details, family details, outside-of-Growstuff contact details, or any other identifying or personal information) without their explicit consent.

- Although we do not insist that you use your legal or "wallet" name on our website, we do require that you do not create any pseudonymous accounts to mislead people, evade accountability, or otherwise cause trouble.  In other words, "sockpuppet" accounts are not permitted.

If you experience or witness harassment or other situations that contravene these community guidelines, you can report it to [email address to be decided].  We will listen carefully and take your report seriously.  Once we've looked into the situation, the Growstuff [moderators? admins? staff?] may take any action we deem necessary.  For instance, we may issue a warning, or in serious cases we may suspend or ban people from our community.
