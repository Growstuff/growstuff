Thanks for contributing to Growstuff!  We have different contribution
guidelines depending on whether your change is a small one (a one-line
bugfix or similar) or a larger one.

## Small changes

Send us a pull request!  We will get one of our pairs of coders to
review it.

If you are interested in becoming a more regular contributor or working
on larger features, please see the [Growstuff
wiki](http://wiki.growstuff.org/) for more information.

## Larger changes

Growstuff does pair programming (two coders working together) for all
new features and other significant changes.  This means that if you
submit a pull request and weren't working in a pair, we're unlikely to
merge it into the project as-is.

If you would like to work on any larger change, we would appreciate it
if you would get in touch with us, preferably via our [mailing
list](http://lists.growstuff.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and talk to
us about it first.  We'll try and hook you up with a partner so you can
work as a pair, either in person or remotely depending on where you are.
The [Growstuff wiki](http://wiki.growstuff.org/) has lots more
information on our dev process, to get you started if you would like to
join us.

If you submit a larger change without working in a pair, we will treat
your work as an experimental "spike" and get one of our pairs of
programmers to look over it and maybe use what you've done as the basis
for re-implementing it using our processes.  **We'd much rather work
with you, so please talk to us first!**
